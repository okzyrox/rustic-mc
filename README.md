# Fabric Example Mod

Hooked in with rust

Note: dunno why but it cant find the dynlib file to load
but it SHOULD work if it did

## Usage

1. Build the mod (.jar), place it in `mods/`
2. Build the rustmod (.dll, .lib, .so, .dynlib, etc), place it in `rustmods/` (create the directory if not exists)
3. profit
